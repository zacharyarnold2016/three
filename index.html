    <p>
      Oh good job Morty! You killed my best customer but you saved a mind
      reading fart! God? God's turning people into insect monsters Beth. I'm the
      one beating them to death. Thank me. Hit the sack, Jack! The fucking amish
      bitch shot me! God? God's turning people into insect monsters Beth. I'm
      the one beating them to death. Thank me. Nobody's killing me until after I
      catch my wife with another man. Puffy vagina. They're robots Morty! It's
      okay to shoot them! They're just robots! I don't get it and I don't need
      to. Wha, me irresponsible ?! All I wanted you to do was to hand me a
      screwdriver, Morty! Okay, take it easy Rick. T-that's dark. This isn't
      Game of Thrones, Morty. I couldn't hear you over my own screaming. We've
      talked about this! Please god, oh lord, hear my prayers…! YES! Fuck you
      god, not today bitch! I'm sorry, Morty, it's a bummer. In reality, you're
      as dumb as they come. And I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give
      them up just to get your parents off my back. So now we're gonna have to
      go get more. And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that,
      Morty. And you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty. Because the
      world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important. And
      they'll tear us apart, Morty. But if you stick with me, I'm gonna
      accomplish great things, Morty. And you're gonna be part of them. And
      together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna- do all kinds of
      wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our
      enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and
      Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever
      and forever. 100 years, Rick and Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty
      running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long forever. All a
      hundred days. Rick and Morty forever a hundred times. Over and over,
